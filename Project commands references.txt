1. create the ansible-machine-sg
    - enable ssh from on port 22 on my ip

2. create the server-sg 
    - enable ssh on port 22 from ansible-machine-sg as source
    http from port 80

3. launch the ansible-machine on aws management console
    - use ami as amazon linux 2
    - use one of the keypair in my aws account: e.g., ec2_key.pem

4. ssh into the ansible-machine 

    - in your terminal on your local machine, e.g., pc/MacBook
    - type: ssh -i ec2_key.pem ec2-user@public_ipv4 address of the ansible machine 

5. create key pairs on the ansible-machine after ssh'ing into it
    - ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
    - the private and public keypair created will be in /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    - navigate to the directory where the keypair is located: i.e., cd .ssh
    - type ls to see the keypairs (private & public: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub respectively)
    - then, cat id_rsa.pub to see the content of the public key to copy
    - goto aws management console > keypair > actions > import keypair. Name the keypair & paste copy


6. import public key into the ec2 console
    - the name of the imported keypair is ansible-pub-key

7. launch the servers, name ansible-servers on aws management console
    key pair: ansible-pub-key
    sg: server-sg 
    # of servers: 3

8. test connection 
    ssh private_ip of ansible-servers

9. install ansible on ansible-machine
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y

10. create inventory file
   - the procedure is:
   - type sudo vi inventory & press enter/return on your keyboard
   - on your keyboard, type "i" to enter insert mode
   - paste the private ipv4 address of the 3 sensible-servers
   - press esc on your keyboard, type :wq!  
   - then type ls, this will show you the file you just created and to see the content
   - type cat inventory

11. create playbook
   - the procedure is:
   - type sudo vi ansible-playbook.yml & press enter/return on your keyboard
   - on your keyboard, type "i" to enter insert mode
   - paste the content of the ansible-playbook.yml
   - press esc on your keyboard, type :wq!  
   - then type ls, this will show you the file you just created and to see the content
   - type cat ansible-playbook.yml

12. check if the ansible-machine can connect to the ansible-servers

   - ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa -i inventory -m ping -u ec2-user

13. creat ansible.cfg file. i.e., the configuration file

   - the procedure is:
   - type sudo vi ansible.cfg & press enter/return on your keyboard
   - on your keyboard, type "i" to enter insert mode
   - paste: 
          [defaults]
          remote_user = ec2-user 
          inventory = inventory 
          private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   - press esc on your keyboard, type :wq!  
   - then type ls, this will show you the file you just created and to see the content
   - type cat ansible.cfg


14. run the ansible playbook
    ansible-playbook ansible-playbook.yml
